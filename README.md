# COVID_AI

Libraries for COVID-19 modeling by means of coupling the classical approaches with AI algorithms.

Short description of folders:

Data preparation - includes the script for restoring data on disease incidence from several sources

MCMC_calibration - includes MCMC calibration algorithms for SEIR models.

PINN_calibration - includes algorithms for model calibration using PINN approach

Surrogate modeling - work by Alexandra Matveeva, contains scripts for surrogate modeling of compartmental and multiagent models

Detailed description of the scripts is placed inside each of the folders.
